### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

*[__Cafe Database Management System(SQL)__](https://github.com/Yim-Koi/Database-_-Management-System)<br>
   For this project I analyzed real-life use cases to design conceptual and physical entity relationship diagrams for a cafe database management system.<br>
   The data base management system was designedd in SQL, functionality has been tested and redied for integration with Square POS system before further development.<br>
   The diagrams were reviewed by industry experts (instructors from Boston University), feedback was incorporated into the design process to enhance data storing and retrieval procedures.


  
I love connecting with people so if you are as well just drop a "hello"!
