# Project Portfolio
### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to my project portfolio!
I enjoy coding for fun and making toy projects. This repo serves as my portfolio as well as personal motivational board.

1. Cafe Database Management System (SQL)
   For this project I analyzed real-life use cases to design conceptual and physical entity relationship diagrams for a cafe database management system.
   The data base management system was designedd in SQL, functionality has been tested and redied for integration with Square POS system.
   The diagrams were reviewed by industry experts (instructors from Boston University), feedback was incorporated into the design process to enhance data storing and retrieval procedures.


  
I love connecting with people so if you are as well just drop a "hello"!
